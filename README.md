### My ICPC Journey: Competitive Programming Collection

This repository contains the majority of the code I developed while training for the ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest). 
The solutions cover problems from various platforms, including **Codeforces, Beecrowd, CSES**, and many others.

Seeing all this effort and dedication gathered in one place makes me incredibly proud of my trajectory. I didn't realize how much I had produced until I organized this portfolio.

### 📝 Important Notes

* **Note 1:** These codes were written during live contests and training sessions. Therefore, some might not be 100% polished or may contain experimental logic from problems I was still debugging during the heat of the competition.
* **Note 2 (Credits):** Competitive programming is a team sport. I must credit my teammates for the shared logic, all the grinds, and support: **Maradona**, **BrunnoRezende**, and **Davi Lessa**.
